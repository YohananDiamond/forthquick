# forthquick

A dirty C89 implementation of a VM-based Forth.

## roadmap

- [x] (old) python3 version
- [x] port to c89
- [x] create words with `:`
- [x] comments with `(` and `((`
- [x] `if(` statement
- [ ] `)else(` on if statement
- [ ] fix bug: anything after >v VARNAME is ignored??
- [ ] what more do i do? how do i approach if statements
- [ ] C integration?? :))
